# ECG Peak Detector

The aim of this project is to detect the different peaks in an ECG using Deep Learning techniques.

There is a file with the definition of the model used, and also the plots of the predictions and the real signal with the corresponding annotations.

Install dependencies using: **pip3 install -r requirements.txt**

Implemented with Python3 using PEP8.
